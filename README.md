🏠 Azure HomeLab

The Goal of this lab to to demonstrate my understanding of the cloud environment by deploying different VM in and azure subscription and create an NSG for the Virtual Machine with open inbound rules allowing anyone on the Virtual machine acting as a honeypot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first step for this project was creating a Resource Group I called RG-1 Inside of this resource group I created the following resources. 
  - Virtual Machine
  - Public IP Address
  - Network Security Group
  - Network Interface
  - Disk
  - Virtual Network

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After Creation of the Resource Group and the Virtual Machine inside of it. I edited the NSG group assigned to it to allow inbound traffic from any IP and destination port to be allowed onto the VM. This was because were making the VM into a honeypot.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After remoting onto the Virtual Machine I turned off all Firewall rules inside of Windows Defender Firewall to allow all traffic to have access to get onto the Virtual Machine. After this I pinged the VM from my local host to make sure I was able to reach it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After Confirmting the VM was running I attempted four failed login attempts on it using the username testtrial and checked the event viewer inside of the VM to confirm the failed log-in attempts were being logged.

Problems I ran into:
- When creating my DCR wizard I wasn't able to make changes inside of it. I didnt have access, I learned this was due to Azure signing me in with a guest account when opening microsoft defender, I resolved this buy setting the signin to with the admin account by default so would would have full access to make any changes I needed to.
